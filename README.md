# PlentinaTask

I have done the task using the following API:
https://api.github.com/

What does the app do:

1. It shows a list of github users in an Android App Activity
2. Then clicking on a list item it takes to the description page
3. Offline support is given so that after fetching for the first time it never fails to show the data even if the internet is not available from the next time.
4. Room database is used to persist data.
5. Apis from Jetpack library is used.
6. Followed MVVM architectural pattern, material design component, livedata, kotlin coroutines, retrofit etc

This app is not visibly perfect as UI design was not put in the main concern here, just completed the functionlity and UX
